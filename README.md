# buff-statue
This Project was designed to where a user can interact with a light sculpture and view a QR code to interact with the hompage assosciated with a certain group. This code can be modified to work in a range of deployments including a touch free screen interface(perhaps a Tony Stark holographic desk)
I made this using
  an arduino mega,
  raspberry pi 3,
  raspbian image with processing,
  laptop,
  laser cutter,
  and basic wood cutting tools.
