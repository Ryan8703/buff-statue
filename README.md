# buff-statue
This Project was designed to where a user can interact with a light sculpture and view a QR code to interact with the hompage assosciated with a certain group. This code can be modified to work in a range of deployments including a touch free screen interface(perhaps a Tony Stark esk desk)
I made this using
  An arduino mega
  raspberry pi 3
  raspbian image with processing
  laptop
  Laser cutter
  Basic wood tools.
